            <h2>What is it?</h2>
                <p>This recipe for French crêpes is extremely versatile. These delicate pancakes can be filled with virtually anything — fruits, pudding, 
                and mousse for desserts, or vegetables, cheeses, and meats for dinner. Extra crêpes can be frozen for later use.</p>
